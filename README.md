# Global Game Jam 2024
 Global Game Jam 2024 has just occured and my team has made a first person maze runner game in Unreal Engine 5! The theme of the Game Jam was 'Make Me Laugh'. After a few discussions, we decided to make a game where the player is stuck in a maze and their objective is to escape the maze while reading all the Jokes that are scattered around the maze. Whether you managed to escape the maze or not, there is always a surprise ending for you!
